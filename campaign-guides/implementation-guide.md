### Best Practices for Implementation

1. **Start with Less Obvious Attacks:** Begin with more sophisticated phishing attempts rather than obvious ones
2. **Segment Your Audience:** Different templates for different departments (IT staff vs. general employees)
3. **Progressive Difficulty:** Start easy and increase complexity over time
4. **Immediate Education:** Link directly to educational content after clicks
5. **Measure and Adapt:** Track metrics and adjust campaigns based on results
